# `Sobel Gradient Filter` Sample

## Introduction
This sample illustrates how CVOI helps to improve the computational efficiency to do the Sobel Gradient. This Sobel Gradient sample code is implemented using C++ for CPU.

## Key Implementation Details

As is mentioned in the description of CVOI, We provide three different levels of optimization methods to help to build high-performance MV solutions. In `Sobel Gradient` case. The Following methods have been utilized:

* **Level One**:  
    Advanced Libraries: [Leverage Intel IPP](#leverage-intel-ipp)
 




### Leverage Intel IPP

To get started with ipp, please refer to [Optimization-Methodologies/Optimized-Libraries/IppGetStarted](../../../../Optimization-Methodologies/Optimized-Libraries/IppGetStarted/README.md)

use `ippiFilterSobelHorizBorder` and `ippiFilterSobelVertBorder` API to replace the original CV API.

api example refer to [ipp sobel gradient filter example ](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/ipp-dev-reference/top/volume-2-image-processing/filtering-functions-2/fixed-filters/filtersobelhorizborder.html)


here is an example code snippet below

```c++
IppStatus fix_sobelhoriz_8u16( void ) {
    Ipp8u pSrc[9*8] =
	    {
	        0, 1, 2, 120, 121, 122, 50, 51, 52,
	        1, 2, 3, 121, 122, 123, 52, 52, 53,
	        3, 4, 5, 130, 131, 132, 63, 64, 65,
	        4, 5, 6, 131, 132, 133, 64, 65, 66,
	        5, 6, 7, 132, 133, 134, 65, 66, 67,
            8, 7, 6, 134, 133, 132, 67, 66, 65,
            7, 6, 5, 133, 132, 131, 66, 65, 64,
            6, 5, 4, 132, 131, 130, 65, 64, 63
          };
    Ipp16s  pDst[8*7];
    Ipp8u   *pBuffer;
    IppiSize roiSize = {8, 7};
    IppiBorderType borderType = ippBorderRepl | ippBorderInMemTop | ippBorderInMemRight;
    int    srcStep = 9 * sizeof(Ipp8u);
    int    dstStep = 8 * sizeof(Ipp16s);
    int    bufferSize;
    IppStatus status;
    ippiFilterSobelHorizBorderGetBufferSize(roiSize, ippMskSize3x3, ipp8u, ipp16s, 1, &bufferSize);
    pBuffer = ippsMalloc_8u(bufferSize);
    status = ippiFilterSobelHorizBorder_8u16s_C1R(pSrc + srcStep, srcStep, pDst, dstStep, roiSize, ippMskSize3x3,
             borderType, 0, pBuffer);
    ippsFree(pBuffer);
    return status;
}
